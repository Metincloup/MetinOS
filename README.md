# MetinOS

I am doing this os for learning assembly and as a hobby


### **requirement**

+ nasm	(assembler)
+ qemu	(for emulating)
+ bochs (for debugging)
+ some kind of hex editor(i use **Ghex** and **bochs** hex editor)


## Getting Started

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Metincloup/MetinOS.git
$ cd MetinOS
$ ./build.sh
```

	** for debug OS instead of using ./build.sh use ./debug.sh**
	
```shell
$ ./debug.sh
``
